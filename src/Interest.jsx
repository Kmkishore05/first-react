            <p> My interests include working with IoT and smart systems, building modern web applications using React,
        and creating immersive experiences using 3D and Augmented Reality. I'm also fascinated by AI and cybersecurity,
        and I enjoy applying these technologies to solve real-world problems. In my free time, I like learning about new tools and trends,
        experimenting with game development, and sharing what I learn with others.
